This is my coursework for Coursera's _Java Programming: Solving Problems with Software_ class from Duke University.  Use at your own risk.  I'm considering it public domain.

I originally audited this class in early 2018.  I've come back to convert that audit into a certificate.  Unfortunately Duke must have changed the data files used in the assignments as the answers I recorded in 2018 are no longer valid.  I'm rerunning all the classwork using files downloaded in 2022 to develop the correct answers.  That's the reason for all the updates.  As part of that I noticed the sets of files used for each question can change, so you must very closely read each question and make sure you run the correct data file(s).  

I use IntelliJ at work, and thought long and hard about using IntelliJ for this course.  Ultimately I decided against it for a few reasons:
- the instructors cover some BlueJ-specific things in the class and include questions about it in the quizes. 
- BlueJ is a reasonably good IDE with a small memory footprint, which means it runs in memory-restricted Raspberry Pi devices.  IntelliJ struggles to run in 2GB on a Pi 3 and runs fairly ok, but not perfectly, on a 4GB Pi 4.
- it doesn't hurt to get experience with multiple development environments.  While I doubt I will ever see BlueJ at a job, it is still good to compare and contrast it with a full-blown IDE such as IntelliJ or Eclipse.
